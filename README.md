   <h2>About 📖</h2>
   
   <p>

      With this application, you can convert currencies asynchronously. The currencies available are: Real (from Brazil 💚), Dollar (United States, among others), Euro (official currency from European Union), British Pound (currency of the United Kingdom) and Bitcoin (an encrypted and decentralized currency).<br>

 <h2>
   Challenges and Learnings along the way 🤯
   </h2>

   This application was simple to make, and I intend to make more updates to it in the future.
   I used the HGBrasil API, which is very simple to use, see the [documentation](https://console.hgbrasil.com/documentation/finance), but just create your key, and put it as a const, and use it. You can also see in [lib/main.dart](https://github.com/felipecastrosales/currency_converter/blob/master/lib/main.dart) as I used it.<br>
