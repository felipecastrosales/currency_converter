The currencies available are: Real (from Brazil 💚), Dollar (United States, among others), Euro (official currency from European Union), British Pound (currency of the United Kingdom) and Bitcoin (an encrypted and decentralized currency).<br>
      The HGBrasil API was used.<br>

   Challenges and Learnings along the way 🤯
   </h2>

   This application was simple to make, and I intend to make more updates to it in the future. In the current version (1.8), I put two more coins, the Pound Sterling and Bitcoin.<br>
   I used the HGBrasil API, which is very simple to use, see the [documentation](https://console.hgbrasil.com/documentation/finance), but just create your key, and put it as a const, and use it. You can also see in [lib/main.dart](https://github.com/felipecastrosales/Currency-Converter/blob/master/lib/main.dart) as I used it.<br>
